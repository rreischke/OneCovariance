; This is the configuration file for the script covariance.py which starts the covariance calculation.
; In this example config file we give a detailed description of all the different parameters that can
; be changed in the code. 
; The ini file is organised such that there are data-blocks (or sections in config parser language) denoted 
; with [data_block] and parameters below this data block with name and value: So for example
;
; [data_block]
; parameter1 = 0.5
; parameter2 = "file.txt", "file2.txt"
;
; The code itself is documented with docstrings and example codes are given in every class docstring.
;
; We use 'config.ini' as the default name for the ini.file, but this can be changed.
; If you want to run the code with this file just run:
;
; python3 covariance.py
; 
; In case you have your own ini file just do:
;
; python3 covariance.py my_ini_file.ini
;
; If you create your own ini file remember that some parameters are optional while some are necessary.
; If a necessary parameter is omitted the program will give an error message.
; If an optional parameter is omitted the program will report the assumed value.
; If parameters are set which are not required, they will just be ignored.

; Covariance-terms section:
;
; Which covariance terms are supposed to be calculated. All parameters can assume values: True/False
;   gauss:       Should the Gaussian term be calculated (this should always be True due to some necessary calculations
;                for subsequent modelling, will change in an upcoming version) 
;   split_gauss: Should the Gaussian term be split into a pure sample variance, mix term and pure shot noise term in the output.
;                If true, the output option "style" must contain list or terminal (see [output settings]) otherwise the split
;                will not be saved
;   nongaussian: Should the non-Gaussian term be calculated, note that this slows down the computation.
;   ssc:         Should the super sample covariance be calculated? Requires a healpix file for the survey variance, 
;                otherwise a circular survey footprint will be assumed. Slows down the computation slightly.
;                Usually not required for galaxy clsustering only.

; be provided externally (see section [tabulated inputs files] and cosebi files therein). In particular T^pm_n and W_n must be read in.
